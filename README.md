ColorDings
==========

It's 2023 when I write this and people still send me mails sprinkled with 'J':s.


ColorDings solves this insufferable pain by replacing WingDings and replacing the glyphs with color emojis.

Building (optional)
===================

Clone https://github.com/googlefonts/noto-emoji


copy generate.sh to noto-emoji checkout


run generate.sh


some assembly may be required.


Installation
============
Copy ColorDings.ttf to ~/.local/share/fonts/


Copy or embed the contents of fonts.conf to ~/.config/fontconfig/fonts.conf 
run 'fc-cache -r' and restart your mail client.


You will now be able to view smileys as colorful emojis (YEY!) instead of 'J', 'K', or 'R' (boo!)
